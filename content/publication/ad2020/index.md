abstract = "Early identification and accurate assessment of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is critical for clinical-trial enrichment as well as the early intervention of the neurodegenerative disease. Continuous home-based measurements of functions using simple embedded sensors and devices could provide an opportunity to improve the sensitivity and specificity in identifying MCI subjects in the community. However, a large number of assessment data points from each individual might increase the possibility of a chance finding. Careful and creative approaches are required to confirm robustness of the findings."
