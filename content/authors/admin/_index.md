I am a postdoctoral fellow hosted by [Dr. Zhangyang Wang](https://vita-group.github.io/) in the VITA group, Institute for Foundations of Machine Learning ([IFML](https://www.ifml.institute/)) and Wireless Networking and Communications Group ([WNCG](https://www.ece.utexas.edu/research/groups/wireless-networking-and-communications-group-wncg)) at [UT Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/).
I am also a Ph.D. candidate of Computer Science and Engineering at [ILLIDAN Lab@Michigan State University (MSU)](https://illidanlab.github.io), advised by [Dr. Jiayu Zhou](https://jiayuzhou.github.io/).
Previously, I earned my B.S. in Physics and M.S. in Computer Science at University of Science and Technology of China ([USTC](https://ustc.edu.cn/)).

My research centers around *Privacy-Centric Trustworthy Machine Learning*. My vision is to enhance trustworthiness (regarding fairness, robustness and security) under the privacy constraint, e.g., federated learning and differentially-private learning. My research highlights:
* [**Privacy**] in centralized learning with [theoretic understanding](/publication/ondynamic) and [empirical algorithms](/publication/learn2protect) and in [distributed learning](/publication/hybrid_fl2023/).
* [**Trustworthiness**] â¨‰ Privacy: Federated Learning <span class="badge badge-pill badge-blue">FL</span> and Private Edge-Cloud Collaboration <div class="badge badge-pill badge-organge">PECC</div>.
  * **Fair** [pre-training](/publication/faircl2022)<div class="badge badge-pill badge-organge">PECC</div> and [federated learning](/publication/fade2021kdd)<span class="badge badge-pill badge-blue">FL</span>.
  * **Robustness** by efficient acquisition against [adversarial samples](/publication/frp2023)<span class="badge badge-pill badge-blue">FL</span> and [OoD inference](/publication/foster2023)<span class="badge badge-pill badge-blue">FL</span>.
  * **Secure** learning against backdoor attacks in [private-data-free distillation](/publication/datafree_backdoor2023icml)<span class="badge badge-pill badge-blue">FL</span>.
  * **Inclusive** learning by efficient [on-device model adaptation](/publication/mecta2023)<span class="badge badge-pill badge-organge">PECC</span>, and [private outsourcing training](/publication/ecos)<span class="badge badge-pill badge-organge">PECC</span> and [customizable federated learning](/publication/split_mix) for low-end devices<span class="badge badge-pill badge-blue">FL</span>.
