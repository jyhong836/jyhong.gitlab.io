I am an incoming Assistant Professor at [the ECE department of the National University of Singapore](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/ece/), and prior to that I will work at [Massachusetts General Hospital](https://www.massgeneral.org/) & [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/).
Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow advised by [Dr. Atlas Wang](https://vita-group.github.io/) in the Institute for Foundations of Machine Learning ([IFML](https://www.ifml.institute/)), affiliated with the [UT AI Health Lab](https://aihealth.ischool.utexas.edu/) and the [Good System Challenge](https://bridgingbarriers.utexas.edu/good-systems).

I was recognized as one of the [MLSys Rising Stars](https://mlcommons.org/2024/06/2024-mlc-rising-stars/) in 2024 and received a [Best Paper Nomination at VLDB 2024](https://llm-pbe.github.io/vldb2024_nomination_Qinbin.pdf).

## CoSTA@NUS Lab

**Co**gnitive **S**cience & **T**rustworthy **A**I (CoSTA@NUS) Lab stands at the “cognitive coastline” — a frontier where human minds meet machine intelligence. The lab seeks to navigate the uncharted waters of trustworthy AI, guided by cognitive science and a commitment to safe, ethical innovation.

<details><summary>Cognitive Science of AI</summary>We aim to understand the inner workings and vulnerabilities of AI systems through the lens of cognitive psychology and neuroscience.

  - Developing general automatic frameworks of reasoning and learning, e.g., LLM-driven Auto Differentiation [[1](/publication/2023dp_opt/)].
  - Understanding the learning process and cognitive behaviors of AI via psychological or neuron intervention [[2](/publication/2025seal/)] [[3](/publication/2025brain-rot)].
</details>
<details><summary>AI for Cognitive Health</summary> We leverage AI to advance our understanding and treatment of cognitive disorders and to simulate cognitive symptoms.

  - AI-driven dementia diagnosis and intervention for older adults [[4](/publication/2024_a_conect/)].
  - Digital twin of dementia patients -- AI-driven simulation of cognitive behaviors [[4](/publication/2024_a_conect/)].
</details>
<details><summary>AI Safety</summary> We are dedicated to developing fundamental computational methodologies for accountable and interpretable AI safety, including risk quantification, and mitigation.

  - Privacy attack and defense in machine learning and multi-agent networks [[5](/publication/2024llm_pbe/)].
  - Constitutional AI agents in security-sensitive environments [[6](/publication/2024guardagent/)].
</details>

> **Recruiting & collaborations**: CoSTA@NUS lab has 2-3 funded PhD positions and multiple remote intern openings.
