I am a postdoctoral fellow advised by [Dr. Zhangyang Wang](https://vita-group.github.io/) at the Institute for Foundations of Machine Learning ([IFML](https://www.ifml.institute/)) and the Wireless Networking and Communications Group ([WNCG](https://www.ece.utexas.edu/research/groups/wireless-networking-and-communications-group-wncg)) at [UT Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/). I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from Michigan State University, where I was advised by [Dr. Jiayu Zhou](https://jiayuzhou.github.io/). I hold a B.S. in Physics and an M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Science and Technology of China.
I was honored as one of the [MLCommons Rising Stars](https://mlcommons.org/2024/06/2024-mlc-rising-stars/) in 2024.

My long-term research vision is to establish **Holistic Trustworthy AI for Healthcare**.
My recent research is driven by the emergent challenges in *AI for Dementia Healthcare*, and centers around *Privacy-Centric Trustworthy Machine Learning* toward Responsible AI where I pursue fairness, robustness, security and inclusiveness under privacy constraints.
![](img/privacy_trust_ml.png)
Most of my work (including GenAI <span class="badge badge-pill badge-red">GAI</span>) follows these principles to trade-off efficiency, utility and privacy: edge-edge (federated learning) <span class="badge badge-pill badge-blue">FL</span> and edge-cloud (pre-training fine-tuning, transfer learning) <span class="badge badge-pill badge-organge">EC</span> collaboration.
* Dementia [**Healthcare**] ‚®â Generative AI: 
  * [Disease modeling](/publication/ad2020) and from [distributed devices](/publication/fade2021kdd)<span class="badge badge-pill badge-blue">FL</span>.
  * [Conversational AI](/publication/2024_a_conect) for dementia simulation and prevention <span class="badge badge-pill badge-red">GAI</span>.
* [**Privacy**] ‚®â Collaborative ML ‚®â Large Vision/Language Models:
  * **Tools**: [Efficient auditing tools](/publication/2023neurips_i2f/), and [adaptive private learning](/publication/learn2protect).
  * **Foundation Models**: Privacy risks of [diffusion models](/publication/2023finetune_privacy/)<span class="badge badge-pill badge-organge">EC</span> and [private offsite prompt tuning of ChatGPT](/publication/2023dp_opt/)<span class="badge badge-pill badge-organge">EC</span> <span class="badge badge-pill badge-red">GAI</span>.
  * **Applications** for distributed vision, [finance](/publication/2023_hybrid_fl_fin) and [disease](/publication/fade2021kdd) modeling.
* [**Trustworthy ML**] ‚®â Privacy:
  * **Benchmark** the multi-dimensional [trustworthiness of compressed LLMs](/publication/2024decoding-comp-trust/) <span class="badge badge-pill badge-red">GAI</span>.
  * **AI Safety** via [automatic guardrail](/publication/2024guardagent/) <span class="badge badge-pill badge-red">GAI</span>.
  * **Fair** [unsupervised training](/publication/faircl2022)<span class="badge badge-pill badge-organge">EC</span> and [multi-group learning](/publication/fade2021kdd)<span class="badge badge-pill badge-blue">FL</span>.
  * **Robustness** acquired from collaboration, against [adversarial samples](/publication/frp2023)<span class="badge badge-pill badge-blue">FL</span> and [OoD inference](/publication/foster2023)<span class="badge badge-pill badge-blue">FL</span>.
  * **Security** in [data-free distillation](/publication/datafree_backdoor2023icml)<span class="badge badge-pill badge-blue">FL</span> and [model copyright](/publication/2023one_image_watermark/)<span class="badge badge-pill badge-organge">EC</span>.
  * **Inclusive** efficient system for for low-end devices by [offsite prompt tuning](/publication/2023dp_opt/)<span class="badge badge-pill badge-organge">EC</span><span class="badge badge-pill badge-red">GAI</span>, [on-device model adaptation](/publication/mecta2023)<span class="badge badge-pill badge-organge">EC</span>, [private outsourcing training](/publication/ecos)<span class="badge badge-pill badge-organge">EC</span> and [customizable models](/publication/split_mix)<span class="badge badge-pill badge-blue">FL</span>.
