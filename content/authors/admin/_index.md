I am currently a final-year Ph.D. student of Computer Science and Engineering at [ILLIDAN Lab@Michigan State University (MSU)](https://illidanlab.github.io), advised by [Dr. Jiayu Zhou](https://jiayuzhou.github.io/). Previously, I obtained my B.S. in Physics and M.S. in Computer Science at University of Science and Technology of China ([USTC](https://ustc.edu.cn/)).

My research centers around privacy-preserving learning and expands to *Inclusive and Trustworthy Machine Learning*. I am interested in enhancing trustworthiness (regarding fairness, robustness and security) under the privacy constraint, e.g., federated learning and differentially-private learning.
* [**Privacy**] in centralized learning with [theoretic understanding](/publication/ondynamic) and [empirical algorithms](/publication/learn2protect), distributed learning, and [outsourcing training](/publication/ecos).
* [**Fair**] [pre-training](/publication/faircl2022) and [federated learning](/publication/fade2021kdd).
* [**Robustness**] for [heterogenous devices](/publication/frp2023), against [OoD inference](/publication/foster2023) in federated learning.
* [**Secure**] learning against [backdoor attacks](/publication/trap_backdoor).
* [**Affordable**] efficient [on-device model adaptation](/publication/mecta2023) and [customizable federated learning](/publication/split_mix) for low-end devices.
