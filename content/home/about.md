I am a Ph.D. student at the MSU. My adventures on Computer Science began when I was still an undergraduate in Optics and Optical Engineering, USTC.  Since the first program-language course of *C* in 2011, programming occupies an amount of my time. Impressed by the spirit of the Open-Source community, I started my exploration at GitHub, struggling to become an open-source developer. Now I am working on research work related to machine learning.
