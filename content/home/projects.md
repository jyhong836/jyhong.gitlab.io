My research vision is to **harmonize, understand, and deploy Responsible AI**: *Optimizing AI systems that balance real-world constraints in computational **efficiency**, data **privacy**, and **ethical** norms through comprehensive threat analysis and the development of integrative trustworthy, resource-aware collaborative learning frameworks.* Guided by this principle, I aim to lead a research group combining rigorous theoretical foundations with a commitment to developing algorithm tools that have a meaningful real-world impact, particularly in **healthcare applications**.

### T1: *Harmonizing* Multifaceted Values in AI Trust.

Integration of social values, such as privacy, fairness, robustness, and efficiency, is crucial to designing trustworthy AI systems. However, pursuing one value in isolation can lead to unintended trade-offs. My research tackles this tension by developing collaborative learning approaches that balance these sometimes-competing values, particularly in environments where localized computation is essential for privacy protection, such as on low-end edge devices.

### T2: *Understanding* Multi-faceted Emerging Risks in GenAI Trust.

As GenAI becomes increasingly dominant, the trust risks associated with these models diverge from traditional pattern recognition systems and demand comprehensive exploration. My research goes beyond conventional threat models, addressing novel risks specific to GenAI and advancing both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation ("red teaming") to better understand when and how these risks arise in new-generation GenAI systems.

### T3: *Deploying* AI Aligned with Human Norms in Dementia Healthcare.

Building on my commitment to designing responsible AI, I am passionate about translating these principles into real-world applications, with healthcare being a key focus area. The sensitive nature of health data has been a core motivator for my work in privacy-preserving AI/GenAI, particularly in dementia care. Since 2018, I have been working on AI solutions for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), the prodromal stage of Alzheimerâ€™s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). With limited treatment options, early detection and prevention are critical for slowing cognitive decline before ADRD onset. My research aims to develop AI tools that are not only accurate but also fair, private, and aligned with human norms in this sensitive domain.
